# TODO App

## Introduction

Welcome to the TODO App! This is a simple and efficient way to manage your tasks. Built with Next.js, a popular React framework, this app provides a user-friendly interface for organizing your to-do list.

## Getting Started

To start using the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run one of the following commands to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Getting Started with the TODO App

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to access the app.

You can start editing the app by modifying the `pages/index.tsx` file. Any changes you make will automatically update the page.

## Features

- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Edit tasks to update their content.
- Mark tasks as completed, which displays them with a strikethrough style.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.

## API Routes

This app also includes API routes that can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). You can customize this endpoint by editing the `pages/api/hello.ts` file. The `pages/api` directory is where you define your API routes, separate from your React pages.

## Font Optimization

To enhance performance and load times, the app utilizes `next/font` to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
